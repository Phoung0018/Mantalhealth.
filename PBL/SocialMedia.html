<h1>Mental health in Social Media</h1>
<p>
      Social media's impact on mental health is complex, with both positive and negative effects. On one hand, it offers a platform for connection, support, and self-expression, which can be empowering. However, its more harmful effects are often tied to the constant comparison users make between their lives and the curated images they see online. The portrayal of "perfect" lives, bodies, and achievements can trigger feelings of inadequacy, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem. People, especially young users, may internalize these ideals, leading to body image issues and dissatisfaction with their own lives. </p>
<p>The pressure to constantly present an idealized version of oneself can also contribute to mental health struggles. Many users seek validation through likes, comments, or shares, and when these expectations aren't met, it can lead to disappointment and emotional distress. This pursuit of external validation often becomes addictive, as social media platforms are designed to trigger dopamine responses. Over time, this can create a dependency on online approval, exacerbating feelings of loneliness and emotional vulnerability. Furthermore, the anonymity of online interactions can fuel cyberbullying, harassment, or trolling, which can deeply affect oneâ€™s sense of safety and self-worth. </p>
<p>Beyond these emotional tolls, social media can interfere with healthy habits and coping mechanisms. Sleep disruptions are common due to late-night scrolling or blue light exposure, which in turn affects overall mental health. The constant flow of negative news and distressing content can also contribute to stress and a sense of helplessness, especially when users feel overwhelmed by the negativity or crisis events displayed online. To protect mental health, it's essential for individuals to set boundaries around social media use, curate their online environment to foster positivity, and take regular breaks from the digital world to focus on offline activities that promote well-being. </p>

<h2> What can we do against these effects of Social media? </h2>
 
 
<p> Like no other mental issue, social media also has many ways to combat its flaws. </p>
 
<p> Don't get discouraged by people you see on the internet, they may look "perfect", but you should judge someone from just a glance of their life.</p>
<p> Try to limit how much screen time you have and take breaks.</p>
<p> If you're feeling insecure, try not to overshare with strangers on the internet about your personal life. </p>
<p> Check the positive side of the world.</p>
<p> Last but not least, don't try to seek validation from simple emojis. Find what matters in life to you like something that is irreplacable.</p>
